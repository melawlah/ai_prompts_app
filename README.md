## Overview

### The challenge
A full-stack responsive web application built to explore Next.js and its integration within the React ecosystem.

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## My process


### Built with 
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JS framework
- [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/) - Database
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned
- Next.js 14 Client Components vs Server Components
- Next.js 14 File-based Routing (including dynamic and nested routes)
- Next.js 14 Serverless Route Handlers (Next API, Full Stack Apps)
- Three ways to fetch data in Next.js:
   - Server Side Rendering (SSR),
   - Static Site Generation (SSG)
   - Incremental Static Generation (ISR)

### Useful resources
- [Javascript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery) - This helped me understand Next.js concepts and also provided beautiful design assets to complete this project.
